In the 2019 folder are 2 summer projects where I built 
massive switch tables and (very) inefficint databases 
in scheme with meta programming. They were fun :)

I made for loops to output hundreds of function calls,
switch table entries and if else statements in minutes. 
I then spent the rest of the summer flushing out 
said functions and bug fixing my logic statements.
